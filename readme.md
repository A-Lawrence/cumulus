Cumulus is a package to be used with the Laravel Vapor CLI. It provides a set of commands to import DNS records for your Vapor custom domain into Cloudflare.

No more having to copy each manually which takes too long and is prone to errors. Cumulus will create any missing DNS records for you as well as update any incorrect or changed records.
